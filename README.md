# header-dhillon

A NodeJS app that dynamically updates your twitter header
with 2 lines of random lyrics from any random track
by the punjabi artist AP Dhillon.

It fetches data from API Dhillon, an API made by [Abhishek](https://github.com/akaushik759)
I found it to be super cool! Big ups to him! ðŸ¤Ÿ

# How to run
- clone this repository to your local system
- create a [twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en)
- create a project and get the keys and tokens
- create a .env file in the same folder you cloned this repository
- store your API Key, API Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret
- as API_KEY, API_SECRET, ACCESS_KEY and ACCESS_SECRET respectively
- open the terminal, run `npm start`
- voila! you're good to go!
